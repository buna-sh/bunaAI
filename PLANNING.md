General Outline:

The goal is to develop an top notch AI application which will help users stay and be productive. We will implement and train our own AI.
We will mainly use the OLLAMA models, And some custom trained ones. The harders part will be to actually design and develop the application and,
integrate it with AI. The AI will be hosted on a Intel I9 server, Paired with an AMD Ryzen 9.
We are on track to start development, But firsly we would need to design the general strucute of the appliacation, Since this is my main project, and 
i want to do it correctly. 
The application will both be available on the web and on mobile. I am first going to develop the web appliaction, And try to integrate that with AI running on
one of our servers.
			
			
Structure:

We will create a good and easy to maintain file strutrure and a structure we can work with. To start with we will have everything in an SRC dir, Execpt the
README.md. TODO.md. This is so we have easy access to our files and folders. We will also make a few handlers, and controllers, Which are important to make sure our
project will be functioning correctly. The first code we will be writing is displayed below.

First Code:

The first code / part we will be writing will be a software in Python that will install and setup our servers automaticly for us. This code should be executed using
root access, So it can install dependencies and update the system. We wil make mutiple scripts to do work for us, So we can maintain the systems without any big issues.
