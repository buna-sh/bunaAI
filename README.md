# What Is Buna ?

We are developing buna since we notice peoples productivity going down. This is mainly because they use AI too much. Buna is completly different, Buna does not just supply answers, But helps you gain the knowledge yourself.
This is done by training the AI to give needed information, And does not simply tell you the actual answers. We have been developing Buna for the people that actually WANT to increase their skills, And dont just want to copy paste stuff randomly from any other AI. We want to see people re-gain productivity and enjoy what they do, Without just not working for it.

We are here, and will be releasing soon. We are currently developing since 2025. So we do need some time for a stable release. Yet the full source code and updates will be here and opensource.
